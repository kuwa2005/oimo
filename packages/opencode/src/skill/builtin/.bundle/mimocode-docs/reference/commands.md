# Open Mimo Code Commands Reference

## CLI (`oimo <command>`)

Invoked from the shell. `oimo` with no command opens the TUI.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `oimo` | Launch the interactive TUI |
| `oimo run` | Headless, non-interactive run (scripting/eval) |
| `oimo mcp` | Manage / inspect MCP servers |
| `oimo agent` | Manage agents |
| `oimo models` | List available models |
| `oimo providers` | List / manage providers |
| `oimo account` (console) | Account / login console |
| `oimo upgrade` | Update to the latest version |
| `oimo uninstall` | Uninstall Open Mimo Code |
| `oimo serve` | Run the server |
| `oimo llm-server issue`/`list`/`revoke` | Mint and manage tokens that let a task reach this instance's models over `/v1`; it starts nothing — see @capability-api.md |
| `oimo stats` | Usage statistics |
| `oimo export` / `oimo import` | Export / import sessions |
| `oimo session` | Manage sessions |
| `oimo github` / `oimo pr` | GitHub / pull-request integration |
| `oimo generate` | Code generation entry |

Run `oimo <command> --help` for flags on any command.

Notable TUI flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--continue` / `-c` | Resume last session (does **not** re-apply `--se`/`--fde`/`--auto` by itself). Global most-recent root session — not scoped to cwd |
| `--warm` | Soft continue: **new** session with a brief from the latest root session in **this directory** (summary). `--warm=deep` also inherits parent context up to the last compaction/checkpoint boundary |
| `--session` / `-s` | Open a specific session |
| `--model` / `-m` | Model override |
| `--agent` | Agent override |
| `--se` / `--autonomy` | SE autonomy (Requirements Lock, then non-stop). Enables Friction Learning (SE lens) |
| `--fde` | FDE autonomy (Solution Lock; PoC allowed before lock). Enables Friction Learning (FDE lens). Combinable with `--se` |
| `--character` | 愚痴モード (Friction フィードバック表示)。未指定=OFF、`--character`=ON、`--character=off` で明示 OFF。学習・推論は変わらない |
| `--spauto` / `--autosp` | Super Auto (self-hearing, never-ask from launch; risk gate every time) |
| `--auto` / `--yolo` | Auto-approve permissions not explicitly denied; skip workspace trust; also auto-approves deletes |
| `--compliance` | Mask high-confidence secrets in chat input before save/LLM (enterprise; default off). See @config.md (Compliance) |
| `--never-ask` | Start with never-ask on |
| `--trust` | Skip workspace trust prompt |
| `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | Same permission auto-approve as `--auto` (without the yolo alias) |

Autonomy modes and handoff: see @config.md (Autonomy). Permissions details: @permissions.md.

For terminal compatibility, TUI rendering or lag, and local rendering over SSH with `oimo serve` + `oimo attach`, see @guide.md.

## Slash commands (inside the TUI)

Type `/` to see the commands available in the current context. You can also ask in chat, for example, “Which slash commands can I use?” or “How do I switch models?” Open Mimo Code will explain the relevant command without requiring you to remember its name.

Most client commands run only when the whole input is the command. `/btw <question>` and prompt commands that accept arguments are the exceptions.

### Application commands

| `/voice` | Toggle streaming voice input (requires `sox` and a MiMo login) |
| `/voice-send` | Toggle sending transcribed voice input automatically |
| `/voice-control` | Toggle voice control |

### Session commands

These commands are available while viewing a session. Some appear only when their action is possible.

| Command | Aliases | Purpose / availability |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| `/share` | — | Share the session; unavailable when sharing is disabled |
| `/rename` | — | Rename the session |
| `/timeline` | — | Open the message timeline |
| `/fork` | — | Fork the session from an earlier message |
| `/compact` | `/summarize` | Summarize a long session to free context |

| `/timestamps` | `/toggle-timestamps` | Toggle message timestamps |
| `/thinking` | `/toggle-thinking` | Toggle thinking-block visibility |
| `/copy` | — | Copy the session transcript |
| `/export` | — | Export the session transcript |

### Built-in prompt commands

These commands submit a predefined prompt to the agent and may accept trailing arguments.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/init` | Generate or update project `AGENTS.md` guidance from the codebase |
| `/review [target]` | Review a commit, branch, or pull request; defaults to uncommitted changes |
| `/goal <condition>` | Set a judge-verified stop condition; `/goal clear` aborts it |
| `/dream [focus]` | Consolidate durable knowledge from recent work into project memory |
| `/distill [focus]` | Package repeated workflows into skills, subagents, or commands |
| `/evolve [focus]` | Self Improvement Session: skills, backlog, friction/HAC, AI-to-AI briefs under `~/.oimo/evolve/<projectID>/` |
| `/self-improve [focus]` | Alias for `/evolve` |
| `/evolve-status` | TUI dashboard for briefs, backlog, snapshots |

Workflows (via `workflow` tool when enabled):

| Name | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `evolve-review` | Multi-agent review of a brief (no apply) |
| `evolve-apply` | Semi-automatic apply **only if** `args.approved=true` → worktree → verify → draft PR |
| `/rebuild` | Rebuild conversation context from the latest checkpoint while keeping recent messages verbatim |
| `/context-limit` | Pick where the current model compacts (`200K`/`300K`/`500K`/`1M`/custom, or the model default); persists per model as `compaction.max_context`. Refuses while a session is running, because the config write reloads the instance |
| `/deep-research <question>` | Run deep multi-source research; the prompt-command implementation requires the workflow experiment |
| `/loops [cancel <id>]` | List or cancel scheduled jobs; requires the cron experiment |

### Skills and other dynamic commands

The slash menu also includes commands discovered at runtime:

- `/<skill-name>` invokes an available skill; `/loop [interval] <prompt>` schedules a repeating prompt, and `/compose-next` starts the recommended spec-to-ship workflow.
- Project and global Markdown commands from `command/**/*.md` and `commands/**/*.md` use their relative filename as the slash name.
- MCP prompts become slash commands and are marked `:mcp` in autocomplete.
- A custom command or MCP prompt with the same name overrides a built-in prompt command. Skills do not override an existing command.
- Mentioning two or more skills in one chat message can auto-load up to three skills with an orchestration plan.

## Keybindings

- `Tab` — cycle primary agents (build → plan → compose). After the first message the mode locks to the free-switch group: Build, Plan, and Compose can still switch between each other. Agents outside that group (e.g. Orchestrator) cannot be entered via Tab mid-session (`agent_force` bypasses the lock).
- Entering plan mode is a user gesture: `Tab` (or the agent dialog) — there is no `plan_enter` tool, so the agent cannot put you in plan mode and will not offer to unless you raise it. Leaving works either way: `Tab` back, or the agent calls `plan_exit` to ask you to approve the finished plan and return to build.
- Other keybinds are configurable; the keybinds config module governs them.

## Notes

- The web command is currently disabled; TUI is the supported interface.
- Voice ASR (`mimo-v2.5-asr`) is MiMo-platform only; voice control (`mimo-v2.5`) also runs on OpenRouter and compatible relays via the `voice` config (see config.md and the README voice section).
